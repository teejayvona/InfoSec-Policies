# Security Policy Development

This repository contains ISO/IEC 27001:2022-aligned information security policies developed to support organizational security posture and compliance efforts.

## Real-World Scenario: Wales Interiors – Securing a Growing Brand
Wales Interiors, a luxury design and furniture manufacturing firm, recently began a bold digital transformation journey. To improve operational efficiency and collaboration, the company migrated its sensitive assets such as high-value design files, client contracts, and financial records to cloud platforms including Microsoft 365, Google Drive, and a custom-built ERP system.

However, as sleek as their digital shift appeared, it exposed critical security gaps that posed both operational and compliance risks:

### Business Challenges:
Through walkthrough interviews and observations, I uncovered key business challenges that could hinder digital transformation and introduce security risks.

1. Weak Access Controls: Credentials were shared among staff, and ex-employees still had access to sensitive documents.

2. Shadow IT Risks: Employees used personal devices and unauthorized apps to interact with company data—bypassing internal controls.

3. Insider Threats: A former staff member retained access to client project files weeks after termination.

4. Low Security Awareness: Staff lacked foundational knowledge of cyber hygiene and best practices.

5. Regulatory Exposure: Leadership recognized a misalignment with ISO 27001 controls, but had no structured way to evaluate the company’s security posture.

### My Contribution:
I led the development of ISO/IEC 27002:2022-aligned information security policies tailored to Wales Interiors' environment and challenges. The policy pack addressed:
- Access Control & Privilege Management

- Data Classification & Handling

- Acceptable Use & Remote Working

- Incident Response

- Clear Desk and Clear Screen Policy

- Password Construction Standard

- Physical Security Management Policy

- Secure Configuration Policy

- Technology Equipment Disposal

- Third-Party Management Policy

- Security Awareness Training

Each policy included clear guidance, mapped controls, and ownership to support internal risk reduction, audit readiness, and ISO alignment.

I also communicated the policies to relevant departments, provided practical context, and ensured acknowledgement and understanding were documented through internal sign-off and awareness tracking.
